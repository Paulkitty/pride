# About /pride
SVG files for queer pride flags. Free for anyone to use, without attribution; I ask that you link back for others to be able to use this resource. I would add them to Wikimedia but I'm not sure these meet the "useful to existing articles" requirement.

If you would like to contribute, please contact me.

# Tutorial 
If you can't figure out how to open the SVGs as text, [this](https://github.com/Paulkitty/pride/blob/main/templates/Raw%20Template%20Code.txt) is a plain text file that you can copy. 
All you need to do is:
- Copy the code
- Paste into Notepad, or any text editor that allows you to save as a SVG, whether from a menu or from typing .SVG into the filename.
- Replace the hexcodes with the appropriate ones to color; stripes are in descending order
- Save as .SVG / .svg

Now you have an SVG of that flag. You can use https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png to make it into a PNG of any size you wish.</p>
* If you want to make a PNG of a flag on this Github, you can click "Raw" and copy that link, then paste it into [that website](https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png).
