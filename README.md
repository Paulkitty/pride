# About /pride
SVG files for queer pride flags. Free for anyone to use, without attribution; I ask that you link back for others to be able to use this resource. I would add them to Wikimedia but I'm not sure these meet the "useful to existing articles" requirement.

If you would like to contribute, please contact me.

# Tutorial 
If you can't figure out how to open the SVGs as text, [this](https://github.com/Paulkitty/pride/blob/main/templates/Raw%20Template%20Code.txt) is a plain text file that you can copy. 
All you need to do is:
- Copy the code
- Paste into Notepad, or any text editor that allows you to save as a SVG, whether from a menu or from typing .SVG into the filename.
- Replace the hexcodes with the appropriate ones to color; stripes are in descending order
- Save as .SVG / .svg

Now you have an SVG of that flag. You can use https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png to make it into a PNG of any size you wish.</p>
* If you want to make a PNG of a flag on this Github, you can click "Raw" and copy that link, then paste it into [that website](https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png).
* If you would like to request a specific flag to be created as an SVG, please contact me on Twitter or Discord. When requesting a flag please include the source and a clear image that I can pull colors from, or provide me the hexcodes.
* I don't really have any control over what order the folders display in, if it can be changed I don't know how. I think they sort alphabetically.
* If you are concerned about a flag being missing, please consider that I may not have gotten around to making it, I may not have been able to find a proper source for it, or I simply don't know about the flag. If you want to me to make a flag sooner please contact me with the information listed above.
* I will not be adding any flags that were made to be exclusionary or bigoted.
