# About /pride
SVG files for queer pride flags. Free for anyone to use, without attribution; I ask that you link back for others to be able to use this resource. I would add them to Wikimedia but I'm not sure these meet the "useful to existing articles" requirement.

If you would like to contribute, please contact me.

# Tutorial 
If you can't figure out how to open the SVGs as text, [this](https://github.com/Paulkitty/pride/blob/main/templates/Raw%20Template%20Code.txt) is a plain text file that you can copy. 
All you need to do is:
- Copy the code
- Paste into Notepad, or any text editor that allows you to save as a SVG, whether from a menu or from typing .SVG into the filename.
- Replace the hexcodes with the appropriate ones to color; stripes are in descending order
- Save as .SVG / .svg

Now you have an SVG of that flag. You can use https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png to make it into a PNG of any size you wish.</p>
* If you want to make a PNG of a flag on this Github, you can click "Raw" and copy that link, then paste it into [that website](https://ezgif.com/svg-to-png).

# FAQ?
* I don't have any control over what order the folders or files display in. I believe they automatically sort alphabetically.
* You can request a specific flag to be recreated as an SVG and uploaded to the repository. Please contact me on Discord or Twitter with the following:
1. The source, preferrably a post the creator made or submitted, or some kind of documentation its creation
2. A clear image to get the colors from (digital, not a photo), a list of colors the creator provided, or the hexcodes if you have them. 
* A flag may be missing because:
1. I haven't gotten around to converting it yet
2. I haven't been able to properly source it
3. I don't know the flag exists
* If you want to me to make a flag sooner, please contact me with the information listed above. Sources are especially hard for me to find.
* I will not be adding any flags that were made to be exclusionary, bigoted, or hateful.
* I will not be adding any complex flags as they are beyond my skill level. I know how to make circles and I am planning to learn other basic shapes. I might in the future use Inkscape to vectorize symbols from [pride-flags](https://www.deviantart.com/pride-flags/gallery), but uh. I tried the carnation and ummmm it is basically extremely long in code.
* https://www.deviantart.com/pride-flags/art/MOGAI-symbols-and-such-Custom-Shapes-CSH-file-880644663 There are these though. Might see if I can use these.
