A list of things I'm currently planning to do.
1. Learn how to make rings for intersex flag
2. Possibly learn how to create triangles
3. Create vertical stripe templates. Possibly they will go up to 15 just like the horizontal ones.
4. Add the brown stripes variants from shapeshifter of constellation's post
5. Trans flag
6. Nonbinary flag
7. Gay flag (mlm)
8. Rainbow flags (~3 variants - original, +lavender, 6 stripe)
9. Trans gay by Catastrfy
10. Generally just all of Catastrfy's flags
11. Genderfluid
12. Agender
13. Xenogender (blank)
14. Demigender flags
15. The flags I've personally created
16. Ply and omni flags
17. Possibly look into using inkscape to converting symbols and adding them to the flags that way (this would be done with complex symbols like the achillean carnation, sapphic violet, etc); this is for symbols that I would not reasonably be able to code
18. All the flags I have saved to my hard drive as PNGs
19. Draft a more detailed folder system
